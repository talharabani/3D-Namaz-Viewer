### Qibla Calculation

The app uses the spherical trigonometry formula to calculate the bearing from your location to the Kaaba:

```typescript
const calculateQiblaBearing = (lat: number, lon: number) => {
  const toRad = (deg: number) => (deg * Math.PI) / 180;
  const toDeg = (rad: number) => (rad * 180) / Math.PI;

  const lat1 = toRad(lat);
  const lon1 = toRad(lon);
  const lat2 = toRad(KAABA_LAT);
  const lon2 = toRad(KAABA_LON);

  const dLon = lon2 - lon1;
  const y = Math.sin(dLon) * Math.cos(lat2);
  const x = Math.cos(lat1) * Math.sin(lat2) - Math.sin(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * Math.cos(dLon);
  
  let bearing = Math.atan2(y, x);
  bearing = toDeg(bearing);
  return (bearing + 360) % 360;
};
```

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- **Location**: To determine your current position
- **Sensors**: To access the device's magnetometer/compass

### iOS
- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`

### Android
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Compass not working:**
   - Ensure device has a magnetometer
   - Calibrate compass by moving device in figure-8 pattern
   - Stay away from metal objects and electronics

2. **Location not accurate:**
   - Enable high-accuracy GPS
   - Move to an open area
   - Wait for GPS signal to stabilize

3. **App crashes on startup:**
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Ensure permissions are properly configured
   - Clear app cache and restart

### Platform-specific Notes

- **iOS**: Uses `webkitCompassHeading` for true north
- **Android**: Uses `alpha` value from magnetometer
- **Web**: Limited compass support, may not work in all browsers

## AI Integration Details

### Gemini AI Service Architecture

The AI assistant is built with a modular architecture:

```javascript
// Initialize Gemini AI with Islamic context
const geminiService = new GeminiService();

// Send messages with context
await geminiService.sendMessage("How do I perform Wudu?", {
  prayerType: "wudu",
  userLevel: "beginner"
});

// Specialized methods
await geminiService.getPrayerGuidance("Fajr", "What if I miss the time?");
await geminiService.getIslamicAdvice("patience");
await geminiService.explainHadith("The Prophet said...");
```

### Islamic Context System

The AI is configured with a comprehensive Islamic context system that:

- **Authentic Sources**: All responses are based on authentic Islamic sources
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Maintains respect for different Islamic traditions
- **Arabic Integration**: Uses appropriate Arabic terms and Islamic terminology
- **Practical Guidance**: Provides actionable, practical advice
- **Scholarly Approach**: Encourages consultation with local scholars for complex matters

### Security & Privacy

- **API Key Management**: Uses environment variables for secure API key storage
- **No Data Storage**: Chat conversations are not stored permanently
- **Client-side Processing**: All AI interactions happen client-side
- **Respectful Content**: AI is trained to provide respectful, appropriate responses
